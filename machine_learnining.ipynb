    "I am adding this having written a good amount of text that follows these first few sections: during the process of working, I have been using an extension for my text editor (Visual Studio Code) called `GitHub Copilot`. According to [its website](https://copilot.github.com/#faq-what-is-github-copilot), *\"GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. GitHub Copilot draws context from comments and code, and suggests individual lines and whole functions instantly.\"* This is the first time I've used it extensively, and it is frighteningly accurate at writing similar text to what I planned in my head. To provide an example of this, a piece of text which may prompt the Copilot's assistance might simply be: `I` \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact recommended text shown for me to follow the word `I` from GitHub Copilot is: `am writing this text to test the GitHub Copilot extension.` As a matter of fact, GitHub Copilot recommended the text `am writing this text to test the GitHub Copilot extension.` in the previous sentence following the `:`."

    "Provided above is a short video showing how GitHub Copilot works, and just how accurate it is at writing similar text. I thought this anecdote would be an interesting look into AI's capabilities and what some of the implications are behand a tool such as this. Perhaps software engineers will be replaced by tools like this in the future. A question it also brings up is: who gets credit for writing the text when I decide that the suggested text is better than what I was going to write (or exactly what I was going to write)? Constantly, I am prompted by the extension with suggested text based on what I've previously written, making it difficult not to write the same things the extension is suggesting. Given that, I've decided to make this project both an exploration of machine learning models from a novice's perspective, as well as an exploration of what an AI assistant decides I should write (both in text and in code. After all, this AI is intended for writing code)."

    "According to [(Sobania et al., 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07875), *\"To examine if it is possible to create novel functionality with GitHub Copilot, we tested several inputs ranging from descriptions of arithmetic problems to specific graphical plots. In most cases, GitHub Copilot was able to make useful suggestions. Even if the suggestions were not completely correct, they often contain the relevant libraries and function calls a programmer would otherwise look up in online resources.\"* Given this information, we will see how GitHub Copilot performs working with the machine learning models we will use in this project."

    "To start, I will explain the entire setup of the project. I've created a virtual environment which will be used to install all the necessary packages and libraries. This ensures that the code is running on the same version of Python that I'm using, and that the packages are the same. This virtual environment, called `venv`, is created in the same directory as the notebook. However, someone who views this notebook will see the code in the notebook, and not the code in the virtual environment. This is because I've created a file called `gitignore` in the directory of the notebook. This file tells Git (the software that tracks changes in files and transfers them to GitHub) to ignore the virtual environment directory."

    "I am adding this note having written a good amount that follows this text: during the process of working, I have been using an extension for my text editor (Visual Studio Code) called `GitHub Copilot`. This is the first time I've used it extensively, and it is frighteningly accurate at writing similar text to what I planned in my head. To provide an example of this, a piece of text which may prompt the Copilot's assistance might simply be: `I` \n",

    "To start, I will explain the entire setup of the project. I've created a virtual environment which will be used to install all the necessary packages and libraries. This ensures that the code is running on the same version of Python that I'm using, and that the packages are the same. This virtual environment, called `venv`, is created in the same directory as the notebook. However, someone who views this notebook will see the code in the notebook, and not the code in the virtual environment. This is because I've created a file called `gitignore` in the directory of the notebook. This file tells Git (the software that tracks changes in files and transfers them to GitHub) to ignore the virtual environment directory."

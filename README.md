## Life Among the Machines: Final Project (IDSEM-UA 2018)

This is the final project in my last class of my senior year at NYU.

## The aim of the project is two things:

1. ðŸ’» **Create** a project using machine learning to analyze a dataset
2. ðŸ¤– **Utilize** GitHub Copilot to witness the capabilities of an AI that writes machine learning
